# playtts
Implement easy Text To Speech.
Instead of importing so many packages, you can just save a text to speech file, or play it right in the terminal!
If you want to just play the text to speech, then do this:

    playtts('foobar')
and it will say 'foobar'!

If you want to save a file, then again, just do thisL

    savetts('hey foo, bar', 'foobar')
(keep in mind that the .mp3 extension is not required)
With this, it should say 'hey foo, bar' and save as 'foobar.mp3'
